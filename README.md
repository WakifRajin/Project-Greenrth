# Project-Greenrth
Deforestation is one of the burning challenges of the recent era that is one of the main reasons for climate change. According to UN news, between 2015-2020 10 million hectares of forest were destroyed every year giving a 35.48% decline for 2015-2020 compared to 1990-2010 and 16.67% decline compared to 2010-2015. As lack of land is also a factor, the foremost solution of deforestation is Home Gardening. We are going to use User Location, NASA’S weather data, Agricultural and Water Resources Data Pathfinder (Vegetation Data) Of NASA to suggest what type of vegetation is suitable for that area or for that region. The data will be more precise as we are using IOT. All the raw data mostly from satellites and IOT are going to show in our user-friendly app which will suggest what type of vegetation is most suitable for that area based on the data.

<h3>Project Summary</h3>
Our project has two main phases: a mobile application named “<i>Greenrth</i>”. It will display our processed data to users and the second phase is an algorithm which will use the data to suggest suitable plants for that area for maximizing the probability of a home garden.

<h3>Procedures</h3>
First of all, a user has to sign up and he will get his personal profile where he can access all our amenities. Our app is mainly focused on “<i>HOME GARDENING</i>” but it can also be used in agriculture, roof gardening etc. Our user-friendly app is going to pinpoint the area by NASA Earth Science Data. Then analysing weather data from Global Geostationary Weather Satellite and rain count the app is going to automatically choose the best variant of that plant, flower or crop suitable for that region. We will also prioritize users' choice and suggest them the best suitable plant according to their desires.  Additionally our app is going to search the vast internet regarding that variant and find the user all necessary data in one place.


<h3>Importance of the project</h3>
Due to deforestation, we have to face natural disasters, ice melting, rising sea levels, global warming and many more impacts. According to the best current estimate, tropical deforestation is responsible for approximately 20% of world greenhouse gas emissions. Damage to forests and other aspects of nature could halve living standards for the world's poor and reduce global GDP by about 7% by 2050, a report concluded at the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) meeting in Bonn in 2008. As the population increases day by day, forest lands are decreasing simultaneously. Ever more people need ever more food. Agriculture deserves a special mention here as it is a primary driver of habitat destruction, climate change and pollution. Agriculture takes up 50% of all habitable land on Earth, 80% of extinction threats to mammal and bird species are due to agriculture, and our modern food systems are also the biggest contributor to climate change. This project will help urban places to become greener and eco-friendlier. We will use the weather data, like humidity, temperature, air pressure, to suggest compatible vegetation. The weather of New York City and the weather of Dhaka City is not that same, and obviously two users residing in these 2 areas must plant different kinds of plants or flowers. Our app will help them in selecting perfect plants. And there is our success.
